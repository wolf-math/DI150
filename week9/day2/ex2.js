// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Ternary operator
// Instructions
// Using the code below:

const winBattle = () => {
  return true;
};

let experiencePoints;
winBattle() === true ? (experiencePoints = 10) : (experiencePoints = 1);

console.log(experiencePoints);

// Transform the winBattle() function to an arrow function.
// Create a variable called experiencePoints.
// Assign to this variable, a ternary operator. If winBattle() is true, the experiencePoints variable should be equal to 10, else the variable should be equal to 1.
// Console.log the experiencePoints variable.
