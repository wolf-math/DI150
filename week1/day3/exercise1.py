# Given this list:

list1 = [5, 20, 10, 15, 25, 50, 20]

# find the value 20 in the list, and if it is present, replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of a value

# Hint : Look at the index method

# Expected output:
# list1 = [5, 10, 15, 200, 25, 50, 20]

# if 100 in list1:
#     index_of_100 = list1.index(100)

#     list1[index_of_100] = 200

#     print(list1)


# Unpack the following tuple into 4 variables

# Expected output:

# a_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# # Your code

# a, b, c, d = a_tuple

# print(a) # should print 10
# print(b) # should print 20
# print(c) # should print 30
# print(d) # should print 40

this_set = {"banana", "apple", "cherry", "apple"}
print(this_set)
