# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Cinemax #2
# Instructions
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

# Given the following object:

family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}

prices = [0, 10, 15]

# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# Print out the familyâ€™s total cost for the movies.

# sach_hakol = 0

# for person in family.keys():
#     if family[person] < 3:
#         sach_hakol += 0
#     elif 3 < family[person] < 12:
#         sach_hakol += 10
#     else:
#         sach_hakol += 15

# print(sach_hakol)

# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

# family = {}

# while True:
#     person = input("Type a family member name: ")
#     age = int(input(f"Type {person}'s age: "))

#     family[person] = age

#     continued = input("another person??? [y/n]")

#     if continued == "n":
#         break


# sach_hakol = 0

# for person in family.keys():
#     if family[person] < 3:
#         sach_hakol += 0
#     elif 3 < family[person] < 12:
#         sach_hakol += 10
#     else:
#         sach_hakol += 15
